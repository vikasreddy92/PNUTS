# PNUTS - A Cloud-Based Infrastructure for Caloric Intake Estimation from Pre-Meal Videos and Post-Meal Plate Waste Pictures

Accurate caloric intake estimation is an open
research problem in health informatics, dietetics, and nutrition
management. Most research and development efforts to date
have approached this problem by designing and developing
automated vision-based methods to estimate caloric intake from
static images. One reason why completely automated solutions
underperform on some image sets is that they do not integrate
nutritionists into the caloric intake estimation process. In this
paper, a cloud-based infrastructure is presented that allows
clients to submit pre-meal videos and post-meal plate waste
pictures. Our approach recognizes the critical role of human
nutritionists and keeps them integrated in the caloric estimation
proces
